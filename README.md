# My Python Learning Journey 🐍  
## Welcome to my repository! I'm starting my journey to learn Python from scratch, and this repository will serve as a log of my progress, a place for my practice code, and a collection of my notes.

Start Date: August 11, 2025

🎯 My Goals
My primary goal is to become proficient in Python. I'll be tracking my progress against these smaller milestones:

[ ] Master the fundamental concepts (variables, data types, operators).

[ ] Understand control flow (if/else statements, loops).

[ ] Learn about data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets).

[ ] Get comfortable with functions and modules.

[ ] Explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

[ ] Build a few small projects to apply what I've learned.


📂 Repository Structure
I'll be organizing my code and notes into the following structure to keep things tidy:

/
├── 01_Basics/
│   ├── hello_world.py
│   └── variables_and_types.py
├── 02_Control_Flow/
│   └── conditional_statements.py
├── 03_Data_Structures/
│   └── lists_and_tuples.py
├── Projects/
│   └── simple_calculator/
└── README.md

✍️ Learning Log
I'll be updating this section regularly to document what I learn each day.

Day 1: August 11, 2025
Topics Covered:

Set up my Python development environment (installed Python and VS Code).

Wrote my first "Hello, World!" program.

Learned about variables and basic data types (strings, integers, floats).

Notes/Thoughts:

The syntax seems clean and readable so far. Excited to learn more!

(...add new entries here as you go...)

📚 Resources
Here are some of the resources I'm planning to use for my learning:

Tutorials: Official Python Tutorial, FreeCodeCamp

Books: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart

Websites: Real Python, W3Schools Python

💡 Future Project Ideas
A place to keep track of project ideas as I think of them:

A simple command-line calculator.

A to-do list application.

A web scraper to gather data from a website.
